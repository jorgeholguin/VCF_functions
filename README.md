# VCF_functions.py

A framework to process variant call files (VCF) and mutation annotation files (MAF) into pandas dataframes. Able to retrieve mutations for proteins of interest using their Ensembl Transcript identifiers. Can also return the patient ID and tumor ID present in the header information of VCF files. See the Jupyter notebook for a sample use case.
